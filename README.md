# Joan Alcaide-Núñez

**Physics BSc Student, LMU Munich** *Multi-Messenger Cosmology | Bayesian Inference*

### Research Focus
I am a physics student and researcher focused on the intersection of **Electromagnetic (EM)** and **Gravitational-Wave (GW)** astronomy. I am learning to use statistical frameworks using Python to estimate cosmological parameters from Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) and GW detections, aiming to understand the underlying physical nature of dark energy and to discern the accurate model of the universe.

I prioritize the development of reproducible, open-source, self-contained computational pipelines over reliance on "black-box" software.
